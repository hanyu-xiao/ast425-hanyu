This branch contains files for analyzing polarization from ASKAP data.

ASKAP_Command_Log.ipynb contains a list of command line interface commands using CASA that cleans visibilty sets.

polarization.ipynb takes cleaned visibility sets and calculates polarization intensity.

polarizationMulti.ipynb analyzes data across multiple observations, and additionally provides data visualizations.

polarizationScript.ipynb and P FITS Algorithm.ipynb are old files and can be ignored.
