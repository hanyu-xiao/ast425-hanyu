This branch contains files for analyzing polarization from ASKAP data.

ASKAP_Command_Log.ipynb contains a list of command line interface commands using CASA that calibrates and images visibilty sets.

polarization.ipynb takes cleaned visibility sets and calculates polarization intensity

polarizationMulti.ipynb analyzes data across multiple observations and visualizes the data.

polarizationScript.ipynb and P FITS Algorithm.ipynb are old files and can be ignored.
