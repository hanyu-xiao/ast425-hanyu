This branch contains files for analyzing polarization from ASKAP data.

ASKAP_Command_Log.ipynb contains a list of command line interface commands using CASA that cleans visibilty sets.

polarization.ipynb takes cleaned visibility sets and calculates polarization intensity.
polarization.py is the script version intended to be run from a command line interface. Potentially bugged.

polarizationMulti.ipynb analyzes data across multiple observations, and additionally provides data visualizations.
polarizationMulti.py is the script version intended to be run from a command line interface. Potentially bugged.

polarizationScript.ipynb and P FITS Algorithm.ipynb are archived files and can be ignored.
